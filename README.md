# Matthew's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage provides students with a place to record class notes that they can use for future study. Specifically, it centralizes notes to help students understand HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as parts of a development workflow. Through this development process, I learned the rough outline of a typical development workflow.
